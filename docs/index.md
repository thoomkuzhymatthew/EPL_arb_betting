## Project Overview ðŸ—‚

**We want to figure out what the best betting strategy is for premier league games.**

To do this we want to create a function which backtests different betting strategies on a Sample of historic premier league games. It will have a range of parameters e.g. stake limits, strategy type, start and end dates. 

We will then be using this function to backtest different strategies and track the returns of Â£100.

## Results & Key Findings  

### Away Odds Pricings 
- **Away odds are priced efficiently for favorites and fair matches**.  
- **Significant deviations** occur when away teams are **underdogs**:  
  - **Slight Underdogs (30-40% win probability):** Actual win probability is **10% higher**.  
  - **Significant Underdogs (<20% win probability):** Actual win probability is **10% lower**.

### Home Odds Pricing  
- **Home odds are mostly efficiently priced** but show some **home ground advantage**:  
  - **Slight Favourites (~57% win probability):** Actual win probability is **61%**.  
  - **Significant Underdogs (~20% win probability):** Actual win probability is **3-4% higher**.

### Arbitrage Opportunities  
- **Arbitrage opportunities are more prevalent at the start of seasons** but have been declining over time.  
- **Arb events tend to have a higher odds difference**, often making a **clear winner more apparent**.  
- **Arb events occur more frequently** when:  
  - There is a **weak favorite**.  
  - There is a **strong underdog**.

## Backtesting Results  

- **Only betting on away underdogs** is **profitable in the long run** (see visualization).  
- **All other strategies** eventually lead to **bankroll depletion**.
