# What is the Best Betting Strategy for the English Premier League?

## Overview

<img src="./figures/project_image.webp" alt="Leicester City 2015-16 Win" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: auto;">

Imagine how much winnings you would've made if you placed all your bets on Leicester City winning the English Premier League in the 2015/16 season. Who would've thought Jamie Vardy, a forward that just turned pro merely few years ago, would lead Leicester to their first ever league title?

That feeling of missing out was painful. And we don't ever wanna experience it again - which is why we're researching what the best betting strategy in the English Premier League is!

This project leverages historical odds from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) and outcome results from ['Premier league dataset'](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php) to backtest a variety of betting strategies on matches from 2020-2025.

## Key Sections
- [About](about.md) - Project Background and Objectives.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](eda.md) - Initial Insights and Data Visualization.
- [Backtesting Results](backtesting.md) - Evaluation of Betting Strategies.

We encourage readers to read the tabs in the order as presented above! This is because insights from the EDA will be crucial in understanding the different strategies selected for backtesting.
